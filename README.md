# Radar MS72SF1

## Abstract  
In this study, we present the objective of the research grant at Roma Tre University, which is to monitor people within a system (such as a room or a house). The presence of a person in the environment generates a large number of reflections in the millimeter wave spectrum, which are detected by the radar in the form of points (or a point cloud). This set of points, called a radar point cloud, can be represented in a three-dimensional Cartesian space where each point is described by a vector [x, y, z] obtained from the distance, azimuth, and elevation angle detected by the sensor.
From the point clouds observed by the radar, it is possible to track the movement of individuals within an environment. This section will introduce the basic concepts related to detection using millimeter waves. 
The main goal is to employ advanced machine learning techniques that allow us to search for structures and patterns within a dataset, with the aim of separating reflections from subjects from noise. There is ongoing work in this area.
